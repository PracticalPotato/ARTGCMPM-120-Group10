Next steps:
Show current achieved score in gameover screen
Fix diagonal movement

John: Diagonal movement is fine, it gives more mobility, precision, and skill, and it decreases the difficulty a lot, also made game bit more interesting. Most importantly, you feel more like in space. If you really want change to x and y axis only, at least give me some good reasons.
